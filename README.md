# Trakt.tv-Alexa-skill
A simple app to connect to the trakt.tv api and add remove shows/movies from your set list

It supports Adding/Removing shows or movies Via "Add the movie {MovieName}" or "Add the show {ShowName}"

You can set your default list or pick the list you want to add a specific list Via "Add the movie {MovieName} to my list {ListName}"

You can ask Alexa to tell what shows are on your calandar for x day Via "Whats on today" or "whats on next week" or "whats on {DATE}" It can also read out the shows. however this is very buggy.

Still buggy and has some issues
